This challenge was composed of three parts and focused around us evaluating the ratings data of certain food establishments in the UK:
1. Part 1:
   Using the setup starter file, we were tasked with importing the establishments.json data into a database called uk_food using Mongo Client.
2. Part 2:
   We were tasked with adding the information for the Penang Flavours restaurant to the database, as well as updating the latitude,longitude , and ratings value fields to the correct data types.
3. Part 3:
   We were tasked with using the analysis starter file to help narrow down the list of establishments to ones that fall in line with the preferences of the peopel we work for, for example, only establishments with a hygiene score of 20 or ones with a rating value >=  4.
